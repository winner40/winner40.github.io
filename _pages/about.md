I am currently a Master's student at [Universit√© of Dschang Cameroon](https://www.univ-dschang.org/). Alongside my studies, I am a member of the associated team MLNS2 between the Grenoble Informatics [Laboratory LIG](https://www.liglab.fr/) and Cameroon, under the direction of Pr [Alain TCHANA](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alain.tchana/) from Grenoble INP. I also receive close supervision from [Papa Assane FALL]() and [Dufy TEGUIA](https://brisco007.github.io/), both doctoral students at the University of Grenoble Alpes, under the direction of Professors Alain TCHANA and Dr [Renaud Lachaize](https://lig-membres.imag.fr/rlachaiz/). As part of this mentoring program, I have had the opportunity to undergo in-depth training in Systems, focusing on process management, system calls, interrupts, kernel modules, memory management, and synchronization.

I have also put these skills into practice through several practical work sessions (TP) of 2A of SEPC (Operating Systems and Concurrent Programming). For example, during a TP on shared memory, we studied and implemented mechanisms allowing multiple processes to share the same memory region. This TP helped us understand the challenges and solutions related to managing shared memory in an operating system.

Another TP focused on implementing a mini-shell, a user interface for executing system commands. We learned to analyze user-entered commands, interpret them, and execute them using the appropriate system calls. This project gave us an in-depth understanding of the internal workings of a shell and the fundamental concepts of operating systems.

Furthermore, I developed a Gregory's treasure hunt, a project that involved creating a set of challenges and puzzles to solve using advanced system programming concepts. This project allowed us to explore various aspects of operating systems, such as process management, synchronization, and inter-process communication. 
I also gained a foundation in kernel module development, enabling me to create a module in which I implemented system calls. These were then used with a user interface program. These practical sessions provided valuable opportunities to apply the theoretical knowledge gained in class and deepen my understanding of operating systems and system programming."

I have a Bachelor's degree in Fundamental Computer Science obtained in 2023 from the [University of Dschang](https://lig-membres.imag.fr/rlachaiz/).
